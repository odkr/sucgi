// Cppcheck rules
//

// Using the system includes causes Cppcheck to wrongly trigger suCGI's
// pre-processor bound checks. So the system includes cannot be used.

// MISRA C:2012
//

// Rule 2.5 advises that there should be no unused macros. However,
// Cppcheck treats include guards and feature test macros as "unused".
// Consequently, Cppcheck reports a lot of false positives.
misra-c2012-2.5

// Rule 3.1 requires that comments do not contain "/*" or "//".
// However, license statements contain URLs.
misra-c2012-3.1:*.c:1
misra-c2012-3.1:*.h:1

// Rule 12.1 advises that operator precedence should be made explicit.
// But Cppcheck's interpretation of this rule goes too far;
// adhering to it would render conditionals less readable.
misra-c2012-12.1

// Rule 15.5 advises that functions should have a single point of exit.
// This is to ensure that cleanup routines are not skipped inadvertently.
// However, none of suCGI's function need to perform cleanup.
misra-c2012-15.5

// Rule 16.3 requires that every switch clause is terminated by a break.
// However, switch clauses in main.c are often terminated by error.
// error does not return. GCC checks that no clause falls through.
misra-c2012-16.3:main.c

// Rule 16.6 requires that every switch statement has at least two clauses.
// However, Cppcheck appears to count breaks, not cases.
// Consequently, it reports a lot of false positives.
misra-c2012-16.6:main.c

// Rule 17.1 requires that variadic arguments not be used.
// variadic arguments are used in error to pass arguments to syslog.
misra-c2012-17.1:error.c

// Rule 20.5 advises that #undef not be used.
// #undef is used in main.c to override the build configuration for tests.
// It is not used for anything else.
misra-c2012-20.5:main.c

// Rule 21.1 requires that reserved identifies not be used as macro names.
// But Cppcheck applies this rule to feature test macros.
// Consequently, it reports too many false positives.
misra-c2012-21.1

// Rule 21.8 requires that, among others, exit not be used.
// But error must be be able to exit suCGI.
